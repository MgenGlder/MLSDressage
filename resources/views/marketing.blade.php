<center><font size = "5" face = "roboto" color = "white">My name is Mara Santiz and I am 23 years old. I recently<br>
graduated from the University of Michigan-Dearborn, and<br>
I started my career as an Information Technology Ford<br>
College Graduate at Ford Motor Company in September.<br><br>
During my time as a full-time student, I gave new meaning<br>
to the idea of hard work. While completing 18 hours of<br>
coursework per semester, I also worked four jobs to<br>
support my goals in the horse world. I was a math tutor,<br>
a riding instructor, a barn manager, and a substitute<br>
teacher. Even now, I still tutor several students and am<br>
still a barn manager, while working my full-time job at Ford.<br><br>
My horse, Ferdinand, has had to retire due to an old injury<br>
he sustained before I purchased him. I spend over an hour<br>
each day caring for him, and I make sure he receives<br>
everything he needs. Luckily, I have been able to ride several<br>
horses for other people which has improved my riding ability<br>
tremendously.<br><br>
My future plans include purchasing a young horse with Olympic<br>
potential, and my end goal is of course, to compete in the<br>
Olympic Games. The Equestrian sport is an untapped market for<br>
many businesses, and I believe with my strong ties to the<br>
industry, I can help companies to enter this lucrative market.<br>
According to the recent 2017 National Economic Impact Study,<br>
over 4.6 billion people are involved in the Equestrian industry,<br>
and the industry contributes $122 billion to the U.S. economy.<br>
Pairing a future international athlete with your company would be<br>
a great way to tap into this market. I have worked hard and<br>
sacrificed many things to become a rising star in the Dressage<br>
industry, and intend to show the world what I can do once I am<br>
able to purchase my new equine partner next year.<br><br>
I embody the values of commit and excellence, and am a very<br>
reliable and loyal person. I am also highly motivated and<br>
innovative, and I persevere when others would give up. I would<br>
ask that you consider partnering with me, with the hope that we<br>
can bring these values to the Equestrian community.<br><br>
If you would like to discuss anything about the Equestrian<br>
community, Dressage, my journey, or your company's future role<br>
in my success, please feel free to contact me.<br>
